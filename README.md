# Requirements

To execute the code you have to download some libraries with this command :

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, in the "DATA-ANALYSIS-PROJECT" folder, run the project :

```bash
streamlit run Index.py
```

## Information

The texts have been created with the help of AI and with my own reasearch.

I want to thank my professor Mr. MATHEW, for this project.

It learned me that Data Vizualisation is not just about making some graph but making the **data tell us a story**.

I hope you will see my project as this story.
